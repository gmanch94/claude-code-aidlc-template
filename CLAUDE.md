# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo. Auto-loaded at the start of every session.

---

## What this repo is

**[PROJECT NAME]** — [one sentence: what it is, who it's for, what problem it solves].

[Optional: one sentence on what this repo is NOT — helps Claude avoid scope creep.]

---

## Session-start protocol

Before any tool calls beyond basic orientation:

1. Read [`NEXT_SESSION.md`](NEXT_SESSION.md) — resume bookmark: HEAD, branch, what landed last session, open items, things NOT to do without explicit instruction
2. Read [`LESSONS_LEARNED.md`](LESSONS_LEARNED.md) — process lessons from prior sessions; re-reading prevents repeat mistakes
3. Read this file — repo posture and constraints
4. `git status` + `git log --oneline -5` — confirm state matches the bookmark
5. Only then ask the user what they want to work on — do not start anything proactively

---

## Source of truth

**[FILENAME]** is the canonical source for [what it defines — e.g., schema, feature list, API spec, pricing].

The `[Used in / Referenced by]` column (or equivalent) maps each row to downstream files that need follow-up edits.

**Never** edit a derived file without updating the source of truth in the same change.

## Working conventions

[Fill in project-specific conventions. Examples:]

- [Naming conventions — files, variables, branches]
- [How tests are run and what "passing" means]
- [Where the source of truth lives for each type of content]
- [PR / commit conventions]
- [Any file that must never be edited directly (generated files, etc.)]

**Confusion Protocol** — when facing an architectural decision or ambiguous requirement, stop and surface the assumption explicitly before proceeding. Never guess on design decisions. Ask one targeted question instead of producing output that may be wrong.

---

## Tone and output constraints

[Fill in. Remove any that don't apply to your project. Examples:]

- No emojis in [artifacts / commits / output] unless explicitly requested
- Numeric where possible — no adjectives doing numeric work ("significant improvement" fails; "42% latency reduction" passes)
- Every recommendation names a failure mode — no universally-best options
- Comments in code: only when the WHY is non-obvious. No "this function does X" comments.
- [Language / framework style guide link if applicable]

---

## Things to avoid

- Don't commit directly to `master` — all changes via feature branch + PR
- Don't push to remote without explicit user instruction
- Don't use long PowerShell here-strings for commit messages — hits 948-byte parse limit; use inline `-m "..."` instead

**Four failure modes to guard against (Karpathy):**
- **Wrong assumptions** — don't guess at intent; surface the assumption and ask
- **Overcomplexity** — don't add abstraction, generalization, or flexibility the task doesn't require
- **Orthogonal edits** — don't touch code outside the stated task scope; no drive-by cleanup
- **Imperative over declarative** — prefer describing the desired outcome over prescribing steps

---

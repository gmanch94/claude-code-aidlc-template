## Open items

- No open backlog items.

---

## Things to NOT do without explicit instruction

- **All changes via feature branch + PR** — no direct commits to master (new rule as of 2026-05-05)
- Don't push to remote without being asked — user authorizes explicitly per session
- Don't use long PowerShell here-strings for commit messages — hits 948-byte parse limit; use inline `-m "..."` instead
- NEXT_SESSION.md is git-tracked at repo root — commit + push it when updating

---

## Files of note

- `.claude/skills/` — 65+ skills; each is a directory with `SKILL.md` (+ optional `REFERENCE.md`)
- `prompts/` — 50+ prompt templates; `README.md` is the index
- `README.md` — user-facing skill command table; keep in sync with new skills
- `CLAUDE.md` — automation section lists all skills; keep in sync
- `stacks/python/` — Python stack add-on; `/test-gen`, `/type-fix`, `/deps-audit`
- `.gitattributes` — LF normalization
- `decisions/` — 21 ADRs (OSS, policy, Argus, general); no sequence numbers
- `templates/adr/ADR-TEMPLATE.md` — ADR template

## How to resume

Open this file. Read it. Check `git status` and `git log -5 --oneline`. Confirm tree matches the state above. Then ask the user what they want to work on — don't start anything proactively.

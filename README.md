# claude-code-template

A Claude Code template covering the full AI/ML development lifecycle — from problem framing to production monitoring. 100+ skills, persistent memory, and session continuity out of the box.

---

## The problem

Most projects using Claude Code get less out of it than they could:

| Missing | Effect |
|---|---|
| No `CLAUDE.md` | Claude doesn't know the project's conventions, tone, or what not to do — rediscovers them every session |
| No session bookmark | After `/clear`, Claude re-derives context that was already established. First 10–15 min of every session is orientation |
| No permission allowlist | Every read-only command (`git log`, `gh pr view`, analysis tools) triggers an approval prompt |
| No slash commands | Useful workflows (code review, ADRs, tradeoff analysis) get re-typed from memory or done inconsistently |

This template fixes all four in under 5 minutes of setup.

---

## What's included

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Auto-loaded every session. Defines project posture, session-start protocol, tone constraints, and things to avoid. Fill in 5 placeholders. |
| `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` | Process lessons that accumulate across sessions. Pre-seeded with 8 generalizable lessons; add project-specific ones as you work. |
| `NEXT_SESSION.md` | Session bookmark — HEAD, branch, what landed, what's open. Claude reads it first after `/clear`. |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Permission allowlist. Pre-populated with `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, safe git read commands, and context-mode MCP tools — so common read-only ops never prompt. Add project-specific patterns here; put machine-local ones in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored). |
| `.claude/hooks/` | **13** reference guardrail hooks (none wired by default) — 3 generic (`block_dangerous_git`, `scan_secrets`, `audit_log`) + 10 domain (cloud-cost, SQL safety, ML leakage, PII-in-logs, prompt safety, OWASP patterns, infra-destroy, programming gotchas, test-set balancing, metric guardrails). See `.claude/hooks/README.md` for the full inventory + wiring snippet. |
| `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` | `/review` — code review with [BLOCKER] / [SUGGESTION] / [NITPICK] format. |
| `.claude/skills/adr/SKILL.md` | `/adr` — draft an Architecture Decision Record with full rationale and alternatives. |
| `.claude/skills/tradeoff/SKILL.md` | `/tradeoff` — structured tradeoff analysis: options × pros/cons/failure-mode + recommendation with named constraint. |
| `.claude/skills/security-audit/SKILL.md` | `/security-audit` — deep security audit (CRITICAL→LOW findings with file+line). Stack-aware (Supabase / Firebase / Hasura / FastAPI / Express). |
| `.claude/skills/security-model-init/SKILL.md` | `/security-model-init` — generate `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md` scaffold for projects with user-facing surfaces. |
| `templates/security-model/SECURITY_MODEL-TEMPLATE.md` | Annotated template for the per-(operation × role × surface) enforcement table; stack-specific scaffolding blocks for Supabase/Firebase/Hasura/FastAPI/Express. |
| `context/MEMORY.md` | Index for Claude's persistent project memory. |
| `prompts/` | **143** system prompt templates across ML, data engineering, LLM, auth, Databricks, cloud ML, IaC, compliance, BI, and production AI categories. Each has placeholders, usage notes, and a prompt health score. |
| `templates/skill/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md` | Annotated template for authoring new skills. Copy to `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and fill in. |
| `.gitignore` | Gitignores `scratch/` (personal workspace), `.claude/settings.local.json`, and `.claude/logs/` (hook audit logs). |
| `operating-philosophy.md` | Portable working philosophy — communication style, context-mode tool hierarchy, advisor protocol, primary-source verification, session management, git hygiene, Karpathy failure modes, design principles. Copy sections into any project's `CLAUDE.md`. |
| `analysis-methodology.md` | Example API audit methodology — 6-phase research approach, advisor feedback rounds, 8 lessons learned, reusable checklist. Reference for similar research/documentation projects. |

## Setup (5 minutes)

**1. Create your repo from this template**

Click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository** on GitHub. Or clone and re-init:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmanch94/claude-code-template your-project
cd your-project
rm -rf .git && git init && git add . && git commit -m "init from claude-code-template"
```

**2. Fill in `CLAUDE.md`**

Five placeholders to replace:
- `[PROJECT NAME]` — what the repo is
- The one-sentence description
- `[FILENAME]` — your source of truth file
- Working conventions for your stack
- The "things to avoid" list

Start minimal — one or two entries per section. The file compounds over time.

**3. Start your first session**

Open Claude Code in your repo. Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically. It will follow the session-start protocol and ask what you want to work on.

**4. End your first session**

Update `NEXT_SESSION.md` with: current HEAD hash, branch, what landed, what's open. This is the resume point for every future session.

Done. The template is live.

## Stack add-ons

The base template is stack-agnostic. The [`stacks/`](stacks/) directory has drop-in additions for specific languages.

**Available stacks:**

| Stack | Commands added | What it includes |
|---|---|---|
| [`stacks/python/`](stacks/python/) | `/test-gen`, `/type-fix`, `/deps-audit` | pytest test generation, mypy/pyright error fixes, dependency CVE + outdated audit, ruff/mypy allowlist entries, Python CLAUDE.md block |
| [`stacks/typescript/`](stacks/typescript/) | `/test-gen`, `/type-fix`, `/deps-audit` | Vitest/Jest test generation, tsc/eslint error fixes, npm/pnpm audit, tsc/eslint/vitest allowlist entries, TypeScript CLAUDE.md block |
| [`stacks/go/`](stacks/go/) | `/test-gen`, `/type-fix`, `/deps-audit` | Table-driven test generation, go build/vet/staticcheck fixes, govulncheck audit, go allowlist entries, Go CLAUDE.md block |

**To adopt a stack (3 steps):**
```bash
# 1. Copy skills — replace <stack> with python, typescript, or go
cp -r stacks/<stack>/skills/* .claude/skills/

# 2. Merge settings — add entries from stacks/<stack>/settings-snippet.json into .claude/settings.json
# 3. Paste stacks/<stack>/claude-md-addendum.md into your CLAUDE.md
```

See [`stacks/README.md`](stacks/README.md) for how to add a new stack.

## Optional: context-mode MCP (for large codebases)

The `.claude/settings.json` pre-allowlists five context-mode tools. These are no-ops until you install the MCP server — safe to ignore if your codebase is small.

**What it does:** Runs shell commands and indexes their output into a sandboxed full-text search database. Instead of `cat bigfile.log` flooding your context window with 2,000 lines, `ctx_batch_execute` indexes the output and you query what you need. Prevents context exhaustion on large repos, long build logs, and multi-file analysis.

**When you need it:** When you hit context limits mid-task — build logs, dependency graphs, large refactors, or any codebase where multiple files need to be understood together.

**Install:**

```bash
# Requires Node.js 18+
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/context-mode
```

Then add to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-mode": {
      "command": "context-mode",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code. The `ctx_*` tools in `.claude/settings.json` are already allowlisted — no further config needed.

> **Without context-mode:** Everything works. The allowlist entries are inert. Skip this section entirely for projects where context limits aren't a problem.

---

## Customizing the permission allowlist

`.claude/settings.json` controls which commands auto-approve without a prompt. Add patterns you use frequently that are read-only (no side effects, no state mutation):

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run typecheck)",
      "Bash(pytest --co -q *)",
      "Bash(gh pr view *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Rules:
- Use `Bash(command *)` for prefix matching (space before `*` is required)
- Use `Bash(exact command)` for a single fixed invocation
- Never wildcard interpreters (`python3 *`, `node *`) — those allow arbitrary code execution
- `git`, `gh`, `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find` are auto-allowed by Claude Code — no entry needed

## How the session protocol works

Every session, Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` and follows:

```
NEXT_SESSION.md  →  LESSONS_LEARNED.md  →  CLAUDE.md  →  git status + log
                                                                          ↓
                                                              Ask what to work on
```

At the end of each session, you (or Claude) update `NEXT_SESSION.md` with HEAD, what landed, and what's open. The next session picks up exactly where the last one left off — no re-orientation.

`scratch/` is gitignored, so NEXT_SESSION.md stays local. If you work across machines, copy it manually or move it to a committed location.

## What to add over time

**More slash commands.** Every repeated workflow is a candidate:
- `/changelog` — draft a changelog entry from recent commits
- `/test-plan` — generate a test plan for a feature
- `/standup` — summarize yesterday's commits as a standup update

**More LESSONS_LEARNED entries.** Every time something goes wrong or unusually right, add a one-liner with a **Why:** line. The file compounds — after 10 sessions it's the most valuable thing in the repo.

**Hooks.** **13** reference hooks ship with the template in `.claude/hooks/`. None are wired by default — paste the snippet from `.claude/hooks/README.md` into your `settings.json` to enable any of them.

*Generic (3):*
- `block_dangerous_git.py` — PreToolUse/Bash: blocks force-push, `reset --hard`, `--no-verify`, and other destructive git operations
- `scan_secrets.py` — PreToolUse/Write|Edit: blocks AWS/GitHub/Slack/OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/Stripe key shapes before they land on disk
- `audit_log.py` — PostToolUse/*: passive; appends every tool call to `.claude/logs/audit.jsonl`

*Domain guardrails (10):*
- `block_infra_destroy.py`, `check_sql_safety.py`, `check_unsafe_patterns.py`, `check_cloud_cost.py`, `check_programming_gotchas.py`, `check_ml_leakage.py`, `block_test_set_balancing.py`, `check_metric_guardrail.py`, `check_pii_in_logs.py`, `check_prompt_safety.py` — see `.claude/hooks/README.md` for the full inventory + behaviour table.

To write your own, copy `templates/skill/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md` as a model for structure, then see `.claude/hooks/README.md` for the protocol (stdin format, exit codes, smoke tests).
